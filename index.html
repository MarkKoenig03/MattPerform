            We are a part of the
            <span class="btr">Thoroughbred Diesel</span> distributor network.
            Thoroughbred Diesel opened its doors for business in 2001 as a
            small, local diesel repair shop. The staff at that time, turned
            wrenches day in and day out while gaining hands on knowledge of
            products and how to install those products. Four years later in
            2005, we entered the world wide web and launched our online store,
            ThoroughbredDiesel.com. In 2009 we built a new 11,000sq ft. shop
            with an in house dyno, conveniently located along interstate I-64 in
            Winchester, KY. Whether you choose to walk into our retail showroom,
            or pick up the phone and call us about your diesel, we take pride in
            giving you great customer service. We are just rednecks that know
            trucks at Thoroughbred Diesel and we thank each of you for your
            continued support of our business. Customer Service is what sets us
            apart from our competition.
